# Social-Web-Network-Analysis
A Network Analysis on the Covid-19 Twitter Network. 

This notebook presents a social network analysis on the Covid-19 Twitter Network. Done in collaboration with Daan Schueler, Balasz Szabo, Ibrahim Alan for the Master Social Web Course at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. This study aims to answer how the ’#vaccinatiedwang’ Twitter network grew and what the major hubs of the ’#vaccinatiedwang’ Twitter network have been within a one week window. By addressing these research questions, this study connects social network analysis (SNA) with network centrality metrics to offer a more complete picture of social media movements in the Netherlands. Our research discovered that while the network’s nodes did not demonstrate substantial expansion, its connectivity did, thus hinting at the intensification of discourse across the ’#vaccinatedwang’ Twitter network. Furthermore, the network analysis indicates a dispersed network that is supported by a variety of people and hashtags. Our study revealed four different types of user central hubs. The users corresponding to major news outlets, government officials, users who influence the information dissemination and small-scale anti-establishment news platforms.
